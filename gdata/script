				Prolog
04:			<callidaria presents> there is nothing as threatening to sanity than memories.
			<a game by lovis trÃ¼stedt> long lost memories, creeping back into your mind, making your judgement all 					fuzzy and igniting flames of rage and despair.
			<running on cascabel> when you realize everything you believed were true isn't,
				<takes a powerful breath>that feeling is truly empowering.
			<written by> some would say it is fate, some would say it is destiny.
			<graphics by> i'm certain it was luck though.
			<voiced by> after all i was one of 'em... <titlescreen>

<Before you can finish off Pavel X a dialogue is initialized>
pavel x (always breathing heavily):
            Hold it right there, *dickhead*! I believe you don't understand the severity of your situation!
            Your degenerate brain inside your degenerate skull is not able to grasp the limitlessness of my powers.
            Give up or face a fate much worse than death!
04:         1) What are you talking about? You suck at fighting. This was easier than I could have wished for.
            2) Listen up *shithead*! Being dramatic is *my* job. Shut and give up. I have more threatening foes to 					fight.
			3) Forfeit all your rambling and pathetic attempts, fritening me. This shall be the end of your free reign!
			4) <surrender> Yes, I suppose you speak the truth. I surrender myself to your predetermined will.
            5) Hey, thats cheating. Initiating a talk sequence right before beating a boss is so unsatisfying!

April's Options before confronting her "father", what will she do while appearing in the fading smoke:
			1) <break through the door> Father!
			2) <break through the door> Guess whos back!
			3) <break through the door> You have abandoned me but I'm still alive and well! Don't worry.

			5) <break through the door, looking through a crack> Here's April
