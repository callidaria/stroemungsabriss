NOTES


<Before you can finish off Pavel X a dialogue is initialized>
pavel x (always breathing heavily):
            Hold it right there, *dickhead*! I believe you don't understand the severity of your situation!
            Your degenerate brain inside your degenerate skull is not able to grasp the limitlessness of my powers.
            Give up or face a fate much worse than death!
04:         1) What are you talking about? You suck at fighting. This was easier than I could have wished for.
            2) Listen up *shithead*! Being dramatic is *my* job. Shut and give up. I have more threatening foes to 					fight.
			3) Forfeit all your rambling and pathetic attempts, fritening me. This shall be the end of your free reign!
			4) <surrender> Yes, I suppose you speak the truth. I surrender myself to your predetermined will.
            5) Hey, thats cheating. Initiating a talk sequence right before beating a boss is so unsatisfying!


April's Options before confronting her "father", what will she do while appearing in the fading smoke:
			1) <break through the door> Father!
			2) <break through the door> Guess whos back!
			3) <break through the door> You have abandoned me but I'm still alive and well! Don't worry.
			4) <break through the door> Great job asshole, your experiment worked after all!
			5) <break through the door, looking through a crack> Here's April
!!amounts to him believing his daughter would have broken down the door with an explosion
		-> then she responds with "wait for it" and you hear a distant explosion while spielzeugparadies is breaking
		-> weirdly cute family reunion
			6) <break through the door> What an Insult! *I'm* the greatest thing you've ever created. Not this airship!
			7) <break through the door> Ah yes, finally we meet. Let this be our greatest battle! <begin boss fight>
			8) <do not break through the door>
				-> April<smiling to herself, making the selected option impossible to select again> yeah right...
(ref.1)		1) No wait!
				-> Dr. Kindsgesicht: "No wait"? what a compelling argument indeed... then again, i changed my mind.
					<laughter> Keep shooting her! <begin main boss fight>
