				Introduction
<sudden showing of yon, hanging from a cliff by his legs tied to a rope, swinging around>
cletus (voice):	Yeehaw, Maria! Maria my dear, it seems we have just caught the cowboy ain't never been caught.
		Thank you Lord Jesus, Sinclair will be *very* pleased, thats for *god-damn* sure. <spits>
		Well, i hope you hang in there boy, he will soon be with you, dontcha worry. <sighs>
		So thats goodbye i guess, probably my favourite goodbye i've ever had to say. So long, yeehaw.
<fat sound of ford f150 suggesting he is driving away, maybe little sand animation above cliff?>
<hard cut to title display, maybe just suddently display title or even with black background?>
<also kick in stage 1 music, gimme that fat sax quartet>
<back cut to previous scene or just remove title from screen>
<give player choice to either cut the rope and let himself fall down or to climb up the rope>
	-> if rope is cut initiate sleigh down stage and give points to chaotic. jump to #aa0000#
	-> else initiate motorcycle stage. jump to #aa0001#
#aa0000# yon crashes into truck from above and breaks through the security cloth
#aa0001# yon crashes into truck from the side and breaks through the security cloth
<female voice can be heard complaining about being hurt and male voice coming from the drivers seat>

<Before you can finish off Pavel X a dialogue is initialized>
pavel x (always breathing heavily, talking like the rat that he is):
            Hold it right there, *dickhead*! I believe you don't understand the severity of your situation!
            Your degenerate brain inside your degenerate skull is not able to grasp the limitlessness of my powers.
            Give up or face a fate much worse than death!
04:         1) What are you talking about? You suck at fighting. This was easier than I could have wished for.
            2) Listen up *shithead*! Being dramatic is *my* job. Shut and give up. You are nothing but a miniboss!
			3) Forfeit all your rambling and pathetic attempts, fritening me. This shall be the end of your free reign!
			4) <surrender> Yes, I suppose you speak the truth. I surrender myself to your predetermined will.
            5) Hey, thats cheating. Initiating a talk sequence right before beating a boss is so unsatisfying!


April's Options before confronting her "father", what will she do while appearing in the fading smoke:
			1) <break through the door> Father!
			2) <break through the door> Guess whos back!
			3) <break through the door> You have abandoned me but I'm still alive and well! Don't worry.
			4) <break through the door> Great job asshole, your experiment worked after all!
			5) <break through the door, looking through a crack> Here's April
!!amounts to him believing his daughter would have broken down the door with an explosion
		-> then she responds with "wait for it" and you hear a distant explosion while spielzeugparadies is breaking
		-> weirdly cute family reunion
			6) <break through the door> What an Insult! *I'm* the greatest thing you've ever created. Not this airship!
			7) <break through the door> Ah yes, finally we meet. Let this be our greatest battle! <begin boss fight>
			8) <do not break through the door>
				-> April<smiling to herself, making the selected option impossible to select again> yeah right...
(ref.1)		1) No wait!
				-> Dr. Kindsgesicht: "No wait"? what a compelling argument indeed... then again, i changed my mind.
					<laughter> Keep shooting her! <begin main boss fight>
