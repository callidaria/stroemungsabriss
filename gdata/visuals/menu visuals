TITLE
over the starting text yomisensei moves from right to left in a fast motion, drawing her sword.
on her way a target (yet to determine what) falls to the ground in two parts.
after this motion she turns to the camera and throws shurikens at the camera position, creating a 3d starfield effect.
while that is happening, john is standing with the back towards the red banner from the other side, hiding.
while hiding he constantly reloads his revolver, dropping already loaded bullets from the barrel, to keep reloading.
he looks very confident and ready for whatever, smiling at something in anticipation.
